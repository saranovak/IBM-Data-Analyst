# IBM-Data-Analyst

The project is focused on collecting data from various sources such as job postings, training portals, and surveys to identify trends and insights regarding the most in-demand programming skills for the current year. The data will be collected through web scraping and APIs in various formats such as CSV files, Excel sheets, and databases. Data wrangling techniques will be applied to prepare the data for analysis, followed by statistical techniques to identify insights and trends. The results will be visualized using IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard, and presented to stakeholders using. The ultimate goal is to help the organization identify future skill requirements and remain competitive in the IT and business consulting services industry.

## Project Descripton

The project involves collecting job data using APIs and analyzing it using various techniques. First, the data collection process was implemented using Flask. The number of jobs for different technologies and locations were determined and the results were saved in an Excel sheet. In the third notebook, the survey dataset was explored to become familiar with it. In the fourth notebook, data wrangling was performed, which involved identifying and removing duplicates, imputing missing values with the majority value, and preparing the data for analysis. In the fifth notebook, exploratory data analysis was performed, which involved identifying the distribution of data, outliers, and correlation between features. Finally, the data was visualized using various techniques to gain insights and make conclusions.
